# Prolog-ASP-Project
This repository contains my projects about solving game of 15 using Prolog and to model a calendar (with some constraints) of a master degree course (it is composed by many courses that must be placed in a X weeks time).

## Prolog
It contains the implementation of various algorithms:
- DFS (with limit)
- BSF
- Iterative Deepening
- A*
- IDA*
<br>
There are 2 heuristics we can choose from:
- Number of different blocks
- Manhattan distance (best one)

## ASP
It contains my solution to the calendar problem<br>
It is pretty fast (less than 30 secs needed to find a model) and is absolutly generic<br>
Easy to expand or to modify
